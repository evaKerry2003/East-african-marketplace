      <h2>Tanzanian Batiki</h2>
      <p>
        Handcrafted in Tanga, Tanzania.<br/><br/>

        Our stunning hand dyed and hand printed
        collection of batiki is custom made for us in
        collaboration with the talented Ester and her
        team.
            <br/><br/>
        Each piece of batiki is uniquely beautiful, truly a
        piece of fabric art. As it is always hand crafted,
        our batiki is carefully colour mixed, hand
        stamped and overdyed in a such a way that it
        can never be reproduced exactly the same.
          <br/><br/>
        The fabric is 100% cotton and already softened
        for wear with the hand dying and washing. The
        perfect weighted cotton for clothing or
        homewares.
        <br/><br/>
        As our collection is always produced in small
        batches, our fabric pieces are precious and very
        limited. Our batiki features in our store in cushion
        covers, bags, blankets and handcrafted clothing
        in our slow fashion collection.
